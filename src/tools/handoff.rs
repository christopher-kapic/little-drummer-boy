//! `handoff` — the `Auto` front-door agent's primary-swap tool.
//!
//! Structural, like `task`/`jobs`: the engine intercepts it by name in
//! [`crate::engine::agent::turn`] and routes the chosen target to the
//! driver, which performs the swap through the same idle-boundary
//! [`crate::engine::driver::Driver::swap_primary`] machinery `/plan` and
//! `/build` already use. The trait impl exists only to advertise the
//! schema in one place; calling it directly is a loud error.
//!
//! Only `Auto` (the default initial primary) holds this tool. Once it
//! hands off, the chosen primary owns the conversation and `Auto` is no
//! longer in the loop.
