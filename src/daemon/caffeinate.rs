//! `/caffeinate` — daemon-held sleep suppression (GOALS §1a chrome glyph).
//!
//! cockpit is daemon-first: agent work runs in the long-lived daemon, so
//! locking the screen or detaching the TUI never interrupts an agent —
//! only the OS suspending the machine does. `/caffeinate` suppresses that
//! suspend (idle sleep **and** lid-close), with the laptop-lid-close case
//! as the primary target, so a user can start agents, close the lid, and
//! return hours later to still-running agents.
//!
//! ## Why the assertion lives here
//!
//! A TUI client may exit while agents keep running, so the OS sleep
//! assertion cannot live in the client. It is held in the daemon process
//! (the one that must stay up). A `/caffeinate` from any client is a
//! request to the daemon; the daemon owns the on/off state, holds the
//! assertion, and broadcasts the resulting state to **every** connected
//! client (so the `☕` chrome glyph stays in sync on all of them).
//!
//! ## Platform reality (honest about lid-close)
//!
//! The OS assertion is provided by the `keepawake` crate
//! (`SetThreadExecutionState` on Windows, `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName`
//! on macOS, logind `idle`+`sleep` inhibitor locks on Linux). That covers
//! idle sleep everywhere, but lid-close is governed differently per OS:
//!
//! - **Linux** — logind's `LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=yes` (the default)
//!   makes a plain `sleep` inhibitor *ignored* on lid close. The only
//!   userspace lever that logind always honors is a `handle-lid-switch`
//!   inhibitor lock, which keepawake does not take. So on Linux we add
//!   our own `handle-lid-switch:sleep` inhibitor (see [`linux`]); when
//!   logind is unreachable (headless / non-systemd) we say so.
//! - **macOS** — `PreventSystemSleep` does not override clamshell sleep
//!   on battery (the `caffeinate -s` limitation). We keep the machine
//!   awake on AC / external-display setups and say lid-close is not
//!   guaranteed on battery.
//! - **Windows** — `ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED` does not override an explicit
//!   "sleep when I close the lid" power-plan setting. We say so and name
//!   the setting the user can change.
//!
//! When a platform cannot guarantee lid-close survival from userspace,
//! [`AcquireOutcome::lid_note`] carries an honest, actionable message; the
//! TUI surfaces it in the toast. When **no** inhibition mechanism is
//! available at all, [`SleepInhibitor::acquire`] returns `Err` with a
//! message naming what's missing — never a silent no-op.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! The real assertion runs on a dedicated OS thread ([`OsInhibitor`]),
//! not a tokio task, because `SetThreadExecutionState` is *per-thread*
//! (the assertion clears if the holding thread exits) and because the
//! logind paths use blocking zbus. The controller talks to that thread
//! over channels. The mode state machine + the until-idle decision are
//! pure and tested without touching the OS via the [`SleepInhibitor`]
//! trait.
