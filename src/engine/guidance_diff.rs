//! Live instructions-file diff injection (prompt
//! `instructions-file-live-diff.md`).
//!
//! The resolved agent-guidance file (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, see
//! [`crate::engine::builtin`]) is baked into the **cached system block**
//! when a session's system prompt is composed, then frozen for the
//! session's lifetime so the client-side prompt cache hits (GOALS §17g).
//! A mid-session edit to that file is therefore invisible to the model.
//!
//! This module supplies the *pure* decision + formatting logic for
//! detecting an in-place edit and injecting it as a trailing
//! **system-role** message — appended only, never rewriting the cached
//! prefix. The stateful glue (snapshot at session start, check-and-inject
//! on every outbound request, baseline advance) lives in
//! [`crate::engine::agent::turn`] + [`crate::session::Session`] +
//! [`crate::db::guidance`]; the functions here are kept side-effect-free
//! so the diff-vs-full-contents decision and the hashing are unit-testable
//! in isolation.
