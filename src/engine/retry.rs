//! Network-drop auto-retry for inference calls.
//!
//! Wraps a single provider round-trip so a transient network failure
//! (wifi dropped, laptop slept, the link reset mid-stream) auto-retries
//! instead of failing the turn — targeting "closed the laptop on the
//! train" (prompt: `prompts/inference-network-retry.md`).
//!
//! ## Where this sits
//!
//! [`with_retry`] is invoked from inside
//! [`crate::engine::model::Model::complete_captured`], wrapping the
//! *whole* stream build + drain as one retryable unit. The partial of a
//! failed attempt is discarded (the closure builds a fresh stream each
//! attempt — there is no resume of a half-streamed response), and only
//! the final `Ok`/`Err` propagates out of `complete_captured`. That
//! placement means the persistence in [`crate::engine::agent::turn`]
//! (`record_inference_request` / `record_usage` / the session-log
//! event) runs **once**, on the final outcome — never per attempt — so
//! a retried call yields exactly one logged inference outcome and the
//! wire/user transcript split is preserved.
//!
//! ## Give-up policy
//!
//! There is no fixed max-attempts ceiling for the "network is gone"
//! case: we retry indefinitely while the failure is network/transient.
//! The *interval* is capped (exponential + jitter, [`BACKOFF_CAP`]), and
//! the call is always cancellable via the existing per-turn
//! [`CancellationToken`] (ctrl-c → `CancelTurn`). A non-transient error
//! (4xx auth/bad-request, serialization, malformed response) fails fast.
//!
//! ## Active reconnection probe
//!
//! During a backoff wait we run a lightweight connectivity probe (TCP
//! connect to the provider host:port, falling back to a DNS resolve) so
//! a retry fires *promptly* when the network returns rather than waiting
//! out the full capped interval. The backoff governs the probe cadence;
//! a successful probe short-circuits the remaining wait. The probe is
//! abstracted behind [`ConnectivityProbe`] so the loop is testable with
//! a fake (the live TCP/DNS probe is environment-dependent).

/// - **`StreamEnded`**: rig yields this when the SSE body ends without a

///   calls out. Treated as `Retry` (discard the partial, re-issue).
/// - **`Instance` with a non-reqwest inner error**: rig boxes the
///   transport error as `Box<dyn Error>`. If it is a `reqwest::Error` we
///   inspect it precisely; if it downcasts to nothing we recognize, it
///   still arrived on the transport path, so we choose the conservative
///   *retryable* default rather than failing a possibly-recoverable
///   network blip. This is the one class we cannot fully distinguish;
///   the conservative call here is "retry" because the variant is
///   transport-only by construction (rig only produces `Instance` from
///   `req.send()`/`client.execute()`/chunk errors).
/// - **`ProviderError`**: a provider-formatted error *string* with the
///   HTTP status already consumed by rig — we cannot reliably tell a
///   rate-limit message from an invalid-key message from the text
///   without provider-specific parsing, which would be a brittle
///   catch-all. Per the prompt's "if a class genuinely can't be
///   distinguished, choose the conservative (fail-fast) default", we
///   **fail fast**. A true `429`/`503` from an OpenAI-compat endpoint
///   reaches us as `InvalidStatusCodeWithMessage` (rig's
///   `non_success_status_error`), which we *do* retry, so the common
///   rate-limit path is covered; `ProviderError` is the residue.
/// - **`Protocol` / `NoHeaders` / `InvalidContentType` /
///   `InvalidHeaderValue`**: malformed framing or our own bad header —
///   not a dropped link and not transient, so `FailFast`.
///
/// `Retry-After` cannot be recovered for status errors: rig's
/// `non_success_status_error` reads the body and **discards the response
/// headers** before building `InvalidStatusCodeWithMessage`, so the
/// header value never reaches us. We therefore parse `Retry-After` only
/// when it is *available*, which in this stack is never for the
/// streaming path — so `RetryAfter(None)` (normal backoff) is what a
/// `429`/`503` actually gets today. The parser ([`parse_retry_after`])
/// is implemented and unit-tested so that the moment a provider variant
