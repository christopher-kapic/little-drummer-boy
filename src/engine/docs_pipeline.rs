//! The two-stage `docs` pipeline (prompt `docs-agent.md` component C).
//!
//! Invoked by the driver when a caller delegates `task(agent="docs",
//! prompt=<{package, question}>)`. To the caller it behaves like a single
//! leaf invocation (GOALS §3a leaf-termination) — the two internal stages
//! are not exposed as delegations.
//!
//! Stage 1 (Docs.1, *resolver*) runs in the **caller's cwd** with the
//! registry tools + `bash`/`webfetch`/`websearch`. It receives **only**
//! the package name (the question never enters its context — token
//! economy, GOALS §10). It confirms/clones the dependency's source into
//! the registry. The resolver tools record the resolved on-disk path in a
//! shared [`crate::tools::docs::DocsResolution`] slot the pipeline reads.
//!
//! Stage 2 (Docs.2, *answerer*) runs in the **resolved package
//! directory** (the cwd-parameterized spawn: we clone the resolver's
//! `SpawnArgs` and override `cwd`) with `read`+`grep`+`glob` only. The
//! pipeline injects the question here. Its final text is the docs tool
//! result surfaced to the caller.
//!
//! If Docs.1 cannot locate/resolve/clone the package, the pipeline
//! returns Docs.1's failure answer and never launches Docs.2 (never
//! hallucinate an answer).
