//! Per-subagent **seed collector** (GOALS §3c).
//!
//! A re-queryable read-only noninteractive subagent (today `explore`) may,
//! beside its prose report, attach a small set of read-only results for the
//! caller. It does so by calling the `seed` tool ([`crate::tools::seed`]),
//! which appends a `{tool, args}` entry here — a buffer scoped to the
//! subagent's driver frame. On the subagent's return the driver drains this
//! buffer and **re-executes** each entry in the caller's cwd, injecting the
//! results into the caller's transcript as native tool-call/result pairs
//! (reusing the `/compact` seed-replay machinery). Re-execution (not replay
//! of the subagent's snapshot) keeps the caller's context honest and
//! cache-stable.
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::engine::deferred::DeferredLog`]: cloning shares one
//! backing buffer, so the copy threaded into a `turn`'s
//! [`crate::engine::tool::ToolCtx`] and the copy held by the driver observe
//! the same appends. `Default` yields an empty buffer (root frame + tests).
