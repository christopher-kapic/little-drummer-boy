//! Compact-after-delegation — hide a cold parent cache across a sub-agent
//! run (`prompts/compact-after-delegation.md`, GOALS §10).
//!
//! When the main (parent) agent delegates to a sub-agent, the wait can
//! outlast the provider's prompt-cache TTL, so the *parent* prefix goes
//! cold. This module prepares a smaller version of the parent context so
//! that on the sub-agent's return the parent resumes from the cheapest
//! correct context:
//!
//! - **Cache still hot** → resume on the FULL (un-shrunk) context. No
//!   quality loss; the cache is paid for.
//! - **Cache cold** → resume on the SHRUNK context. The cold re-read is
//!   of a smaller prefix.
//!
//! ## The staleness trap (correctness #1)
//!
//! The parent's prefix staleness is measured from **delegation start**
//! (the parent's last inference — the turn that emitted the `task` call),
//! NOT from [`Session::seconds_since_last_send`]. The sub-agent shares the
//! parent's [`Session`] and calls `note_send()` on every one of its turns,
//! which would reset the session-global timer and make the parent's cold
//! prefix look hot. So we capture an [`Instant`] when delegation begins
//! and compute the cold decision from
//! [`DelegationShrink::elapsed_secs`]. The parent and child have distinct
//! provider-side cache entries (different prefixes/system prompts), so the
//! child's sends never refresh the parent's cache.
//!
//! ## Eager vs lazy
//!
//! - **No-cache provider** (`cache.mode == none`): EAGER — shrink
//!   immediately at delegation start. No cache to protect; the shrink
//!   latency hides under the delegation.
//! - **Cache-capable provider**: LAZY — only if the sub-agent is still
//!   running at `ttl_secs - margin_secs` do we kick the shrink off in
//!   parallel. A fast delegation (returns before that) wastes no shrink.
//!
//! ## Wire-only (GOALS §14)
//!
//! Like prune, the shrink touches the model-bound `Vec<Message>` history
//! only. The on-disk transcript + TUI scrollback keep full fidelity.
